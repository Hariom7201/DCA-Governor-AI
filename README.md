# DCA-Governor AI

An AI-powered autonomous governance and recovery intelligence platform designed to transform FedEx's Debt Collection Agency (DCA) management.

## Problem
FedEx manages thousands of overdue accounts through external DCAs using manual, fragmented processes leading to poor visibility, weak accountability, and delayed recoveries.

## Solution
DCA-Governor AI introduces an autonomous AI governance layer that:
- Intelligently allocates cases
- Predicts recovery outcomes
- Scores DCA trust and compliance
- Enforces SOPs automatically
- Provides real-time analytics

## Repository Structure
- backend/: API, AI logic, SOP engine
- frontend/: Streamlit-based UI
- data/: Sample datasets
- models/: Trained / placeholder ML models
- architecture/: System design and diagrams

## Tech Stack
- Backend: Python, FastAPI
- ML: Scikit-learn
- Frontend: Streamlit
- Database: SQLite / PostgreSQL

## Status
Prototype / MVP for FedEx SMART Hackathon (IIT Madras)

## Note to Evaluators
This repository contains a working MVP prototype and architectural foundation.
Code may be enhanced further until one day before the final round as per hackathon rules.
